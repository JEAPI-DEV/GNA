# G.N.A (=> Gamma Not Arduino)

First off, don't hate me for that Name. Secondly, as of right now, the version P1 (Prototype 1), is not tested, cuz I didn't want to solder it, and JLCPCB (the manufacturer where I planned to order it did not offer two Components that being the PCA9555D, and the ADM8-272-T3 Crystal).

You are free to use this project of mine however you would like, I just wanted to use this project as an experience. 
I case you plan on letting one be manufactured, let me know if it works or not.

Feel free to let me know of any improvements, it's always fun to learn new things.

Note: Gerber, BOM, CLP are already generated.
